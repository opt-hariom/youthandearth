There are minor differences between the capsule and liquid version. The liquid version has a higher dosage per serving however one bottle finishes around 5 days earlier (25 days) compared to the capsule version, whereas the capsule version has a lower dosage per serving but one bottle lasts slightly longer (30 days). We believe that the choice of liquid or capsule version is a personal decision according to the preference of our customers, as there are no major differences between these products.<\/p>"}},"76c98a97-50c0-40d9-a188-bb11627e616f":{"type":"content","settings":{"title":"What is the difference between NMN and NR?

It is felt that NMN might work better in cells and NR better in some other organs.<\/p><p>We generally recommend NMN powder be taken sublingually as this is when we see the best results. Typically, two scoops a day under the tongue will do it, just hold it and let it dissolve. However, if this taste is not for you then the NR Delayed Release capsules would be stronger than mixing the NMN in water.<\/p><p>On occasion, when customers have not experienced the desired results with NMN, they have reverted to NR and have seen positive results.<\/p>"}},"22c6c8bd-a5d7-4879-92b9-6f2e70b0915e":{"type":"heading","settings":{"title":"<h1>Taste and Preferences<\/h1>"}},"7a38b43e-c5a7-4659-b906-3da703d9dd32":{"type":"content","settings":{"title":"I found the taste of Glutathione too strong, what can I do?","answer":"<p>Some people may find the taste of Glutathione too strong.
